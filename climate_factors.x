<title>Factors affecting the climate
</title>
<para>Climate is usually a pretty stable system.  Oscillations do occurs, yet they are predictable.  Sometime things happen which affect the climate, but are not predictable.  Such things as volcanic eruptions and impact events from space do leave their mark on the climate and have a profound impact on history.</para>

</title>
<para>When volcanoes erupt, they are grade on what is called the Volcanic Explosivity Index.  This is a scale from 1 to 8.  An eruption of 6 or above is going to significantly effect the climate for a few years.

The eruption which create the Year without a Summer (1815 - Tambora) was a 7 on the VEI.</para>

<title>Impact Events
<indexterm><primary>Impact Event</primary></indexterm>
</title>
<para>The frequency of impact events is inconclusive as to how often a history changer occurs.  The climate effects comes from the impact ejaculate being blown into the atmosphere as if it were a volcanic event.
</para><para>
A potential measure would be the check the ammonia levels in the ice core caps to determine if there is a relationship to impact events and high levels.  The level of the 535 impact event was the second highest of the last 2,000 year in the Greenland ice cores.  The highest in that time frame was at 1014 AD.</para>

 are events which have occurred in the climate of the earth on a regularly reoccurring basis of about 1470 years.  They are observed in sediments that come from changes in the ice flows in the Arctic.<footnote><para>http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond et al., 1997 Millenial Scale Holocene Change.pdf</para></footnote></para>
