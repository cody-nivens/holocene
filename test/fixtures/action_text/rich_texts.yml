    The first major Impact Event in recorded history.  It took almost 15 years to find the explosion point due to its remoteness in Siberia.  Recent models show an explosion of an asteroid above the earth with a small Impact Event.  The wide spread destruction was due to the mid-air explosion.

    People in London were able to read the new paper at night for 8 days after the event.  It was heard around the world.
