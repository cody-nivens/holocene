I call this the Confusion of Civilization as there are two floods in this region.   Noah's flood a thousand year before and now the Babylonian flood.   This flood was not as world wide as Noah's and left a distinct mark in history.  In the digs in Iraq, there is a layer of mud over remains.  The area of Umm al Bini would have been ocean estuary in 2,300BC's  so the impact was more a mud spatter than a real water impact.
