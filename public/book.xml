      <body>&lt;p&gt;This book started with the book 'After the Ice'.  
During it's reading, I began to look at history in a different way.  
Previously, I had followed the tradition of cultural forces verses population as the main driver of history. 
'After the Ice' presented the idea that the environment's changes and the trail left by various peoples as they have struggled to live and ensure they children's survival influenced the development of civilization.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Brian Fagan's books and their assorted information on climate and its affect on history further informed this concept with data in recorded history.
Patterns in weather and their effects on the history of people became very apparent. 
Yet it was apparent from these books that weather could not explain all the various changes in the development of civilization.
A question formed in my mind as to what caused the breaks in historical development.  
Richard Stothers' work presented the Global Winter pattern by applying to many cases in the last 2,000 years.  
These cases showed a simple elegant solution for these drop-outs of history.  
Other historical periods should also have simple solutions as their causes especially when changes are wide spread.  
A simple bad winter in one region may not affect another.  When it does, then a solution should explain why.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This search has lead me to the Holocene Project's work and its importance to our future as well as its significance to our past.  
While many argue that such events can not happen or happen so infrequently that their significance in history are not relevant, the 2011 earthquake at Fukushima has showed that ignoring the past can have disastrous consequences.  
The nuclear disaster would not have happened if the project proponents had not ignored evidence of tsunamis that were not within written history and instead relied upon written records.  
Past civilizations may not have had the scientific sophistication to recognize what was happening, but they could record it in the limited world view they held.  
Such recording must not be ignored if we are to understand the dynamics of history.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In writing this book, I understand that I run the risk of the wrath of many group.
Many will of course state that I do not have the credentials to present this information.
My experience is in Computer Science, not Geology or History.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Second, various religious communities will not like a possible explanation for the beginnings of the Bible.
My faith does not suffer when archaeology shows that events in the Bible can be dated to an era different from the calculations based on the 'begets'.  
It is not the document that matters, it is the fact that this book's relevance has endured that is the important thing.  
Today many advocate beliefs that differ from what the central figure of their religion believed and stated.  
Yet, they feel that their faith ensured that what they believe and how they behave are okay with their founder because they have a statement of faith that their deity would not let them believe anything that would be inconsistent with the founder's teachings.
Such is not my faith.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Third, Climate deniers will not like the concept that climate can effect history.  
They believe that by ignoring the reality of the world, they can influence it.  
The Bible's admonishment to go forth and multiple can not be hindered by science which is after all evil as reason is the product of the Devil.  
A planet with limited resources does play a part in the Bible.  
Many great events of destruction have been a result of the God's wrath again the raise in population of 'sinful' people.  
The Book of Revelations seems to indicate that such destruction of resources will herald the return of the Christ so such things must be good since the faster we destroy them, the sooner that Christ returns.
With the advent of the Atomic Age, many people fell into the belief that if we destroy the world with the bomb, the Good Lord will return.  
Such a belief that God can be manipulated by our actions is hubris at best.
Christ will return in his own time not at a time set by Man.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last, there are those who seem to believe that preparing for the possibility that an event can occur which preclude the ability of the government to help its people is either an act of terrorism or one of treason.
Such beliefs are understandable given the actions of a few.
Yet to label all because of such behavior is to limit the ability to recognize the difference between reality, truth and the Truth.  
Such behavior endangers the very government which professes to know what is best for all.
Mormonism despite it past has a prophecy which states that they will be the salvation of America.
Such a believe could be based on the fact that they prepare for the possibility of events outlined in this book.
Such a belief is worthy of faith indeed.

      <body>&lt;p&gt;My maternal grandmother corralled my one day just before I went off to college.
She expounded to me the history of the Bible and that someday I or someone else would demonstrate it's validity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since, I have watched the fate of archaeology as one school and then another demonstrated why or why not biblical events could occur.
Much of these excursions seem to be trying to either ignore reality or at best relabel it as something other than what it is.

      <name>The Holocene Impact Event </name>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;14,800 years ago, Earth started out of the last ice-age.
This warming enabled humans to move north and hunt the megafauna to extinction.
They created hunting camps along the way bringing their family/clan up into Europe, Anatolia and the Middle East.
As time went by various places began to be used as semi-permeate camps.
Some of these camps had wild cereals near-by.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The gathering and processing of these grains into breads around 12,500 BC started the march to agriculture.

      <body>&lt;p&gt;
Climatology is the study of the interaction of the atmosphere, the oceans and the land to produce the observed climatic effects - the weather.   
The atmosphere was the first mass influence on the earth studied.  
It is simple enough to do so, barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction are simple to chart.  
Yet, how they will differ from season to season and year to year was shown than the real driving engine of the world climate is the oceans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are three major factors affecting climate.  First, the major factor is the oceans as their currents and patterns influence the majority of the 
Earth.  Second, solar affects the atmosphere via solar heating.  Heat creates thermal updrafts which affect the circulation of the air.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third factor affecting the climate are events which can not be predicted, yet have a global impact.
These events are volcanoes and meteor impacts.  If a volcanic eruption is large enough, it can directly affect the weather by sulfuric acid cooling t
he atmosphere as well as the cooling effect of the shadowing of the oceans by the ash cloud created by the eruption.  
Eruptions which are spaced close together can have an accumulative affect.  
These events can create a Global Winter which affecting all parts of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This section discuses the ocean circulation patterns and how they affect various regions of the world.  
Catastrophic events are then covered by examining volcanic eruptions and impacts.  
Then a definition of Global Winter is formed as well as a discussion of what such a winter entails.
